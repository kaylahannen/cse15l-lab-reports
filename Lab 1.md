Example 1: cd, no argument

I ran the cd command with no argument out of the home directory. Nothing appeared to change, because running cd with no command returns the implementer to the home directory (which I was already in). The directory stayed the same, and there was no output in the terminal. There was no error produced by this.

Example 2: cd, directory argument

When I ran the cd command out of the home directory with a directory argument, the working directory changed to the directory I chose (lecture 1). This occurred because the cd command functions to change the directory. There was no error produced by this.

Example 3: cd, file argument

When I ran the cd command with a file argument, I received a message in the terminal stating that the argument is "Not a directory". The working directory was not changed. This is technically an error as the command is specific to directory arguments and will not work with a file argument.

Example 4: ls, no argument
